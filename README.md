# NIR-D-pedestrian-detection
PDS-RAFF implements a deep learning model for pedestrian detection using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Depth (D) images. It employs attention mechanisms and feature fusion to enhance accuracy in challenging environments. The project includes data loading, model training, and testing modules, facilitating robust evaluation.
